## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, focusing on the principles that enable developers to create modular and maintainable software. Through hands-on coding, I have deepened my understanding of these core concepts. This resource is designed for anyone looking to enhance their skills in OOP and core Java.

## Core Concepts of OOP

### Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and methods.
- **Object**: An instance of a class representing a specific implementation.

### Abstraction

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary parts. In Java, this can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some components to protect the objectâ€™s integrity.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class, promoting code reusability.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for method overloading and overriding.

## Java OOP Features

1. **Reusability**: Through inheritance, classes can reuse code.
2. **Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows for dynamic method resolution.
3. **Organized Code**: Classes and objects structure code logically.
4. **Security**: Encapsulation protects object state and behavior.
